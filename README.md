# Diary-Deck

ABSTRACT

Users can keep a personal record in this project, just like they would in a diary. They can keep track of essential events such as meetings and other day-to-day responsibilities. They also have the ability to add, view, modify, and remove records.
Records can contain a variety of information, such as task duration, time and date, and so on. The entire system is password protected, ensuring the safety of the data. Its goal is to cut down on time spent looking through past records in a physical diary.
The system also aims to improve user services by providing meaningful, consistent, and timely data and information, as well as promoting efficiency by transforming paper procedures to electronic form. Because of the attention given to its development, the system is error-free, highly efficient, and time-saving. The system is designed to accommodate future growth. 


INTRODUCTION


As eminent by it's name, (DIARY DECK)Personal Diary Management System relies on the idea of keeping personal records and with options to update, delete and edits those records. The interface is user-friendly. Users can easily add their personal records safely as the system is password protected. The whole system is designed in "Java" language, "SWING" is used for GUI and "Derby" database for storing records. 









PROBLEM STATEMENT


Paper diaries can take up a lot of room, and the amount of paper used will grow with each passing day. It is critical for any user to safeguard their personal diaries. If someone gets their hands on those journals/diaries by accident, they can read the user's private thoughts and other crucial information.
Physical diaries can be easily misplaced, misused, or damaged, whereas digital diaries can be encrypted and safely stored on hard discs or other devices.
If you want to make changes to a paper-based diary, you will need to write all the content again. This will need to be repeated every time you want to make more corrections. And one of the largest drawbacks of paper diaries is it's bad for the environment, since many trees had to be cut down to make paper for these diaries. Therefore, because of these drawbacks, the Personal Diary Management system has been developed to deal with the issues listed above.


	
LITERATURE REVIEW


Keeping diaries to record the facts of our daily lives will aid us in staying organized. Diaries assist us in organizing and rationalizing our ideas. You can keep track of daily activities, as well as your ideas and feelings about certain experiences or points of view. Your objectives, ambitions, dream, and new year resolutions can all be written down in a diary.
By writing them down in a diary, you can track your progress and stay inspired to reach your next goal! Keeping a diary can also help people manage their time better. We can use a diary to reflect on our experiences in order to better plan for future duties.




OBJECTIVES


The main objective is to develop a robust system for users who want to record their daily events, thoughts or feelings, and those who want to keep track of their daily tasks.
Specific Objectives -
1. Keep track of day-to-day tasks.
2. Keep records of daily events, thoughts etc.
3. Write goals and monitor progress.
4. Improve time management by organizing tasks.



DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

The main method involves doing a feasibility study, gathering data, conducting a system analysis and design, and building and implementing a (DIARY DECK) Personal Diary Management System. The data needed to develop the system was gathered and examined. From requirement definition to system and software design, implementation, and so on, the system follows a succession of events. Different components of other models were used, such as prototyping, to help with system definition and analysis, use case diagrams, and class diagrams. 
The required information was gathered, including the types of records that a user saves in a journal, as well as key details such as time and date, content, and so on. The data collected helped to identify attributes, relationships, classes, entities/objects that describe, relate and interact with the system. A relational database design was used to design the database. A RDBMS provides a structure which is flexible enough to accommodate almost any kind of data.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE

This system has its scope with every user who wants to record their daily events, thoughts or feelings, those who wants to keep track of their daily tasks. This system provides an advanced way to store records. It has a graphical user interface which makes it easier for anyone to use. And since it is password protected, all the records of the user are safe and protected. It also helps in saving trees by eliminating the use of paper diaries.
